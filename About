E-Commerce React Project – Diagram Explanation
1️⃣ Central Concept

The central idea of the project is an E-Commerce Website built using React.

The diagram shows the structure of the project: components, pages, API, and workflow.

Data for products comes from an API or mock backend.

2️⃣ Components (src/Components)
Header

Located at the top of every page.

Features:

Logo / Branding

Navigation links (Home, Categories, etc.)

Search bar (to search products)

Always visible on all pages.

Footer

Located at the bottom of every page.

Features:

Contact information

Copyright / Legal info

Also consistently visible.

Products

Shows product cards.

Features:

Product image

Name & Price

Add to Cart button (future functionality)

Used in Home Page and Category Page.

PageContent

Main layout for content on a page.

Helps organize components inside pages.

Routes

Manages page navigation using React Router DOM.

Allows switching between Home, Category, or future pages without page reload.

3️⃣ Pages (src/Pages)
Home Page

The landing page of the website.

Features:

Featured Products

Categories preview

Promotions / banners

Category Page

Shows products of a specific category.

Features:

Filters (by price, category, rating – future)

Sorting (optional)

4️⃣ API / Data Handling (src/API)

API/index.js is used to fetch products data.

Can fetch from:

Mock JSON data

Real backend (Node.js, Firebase, etc.)

Dynamically populates Home Page and Category Page with products.

5️⃣ Workflow / Flow (From Diagram)

User opens Home Page → sees featured products & categories.

User clicks a category → navigates to Category Page → products displayed dynamically.

Header and Footer remain visible for consistent layout.

Products are fetched from API / backend.

Future: User adds items to Cart → Checkout.

6️⃣ Key Features (Shown in Diagram)

Modular React components for reusability.

Routing for smooth navigation without page reload.

Dynamic product display using API.

Ready for future enhancements:

Shopping Cart & Checkout

User Authentication (Login/Signup)

Filters and Search

Payment Integration (Stripe / PayPal)

Responsive design for mobile devices
